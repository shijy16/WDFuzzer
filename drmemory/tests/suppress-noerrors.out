# i#292: There are 5 leaks and 2 possible leaks, all of which we suppress.  The
# 5th leak is still reachable from RtlpHeapFailureInfo on Vista+.  If we have
# ntdll.pdb we find and ignore roots in RtlpHeapFailureInfo, giving us 7
# suppressed leaks.  If we don't have ntdll.pdb, we only find 4+2 leaks.  Unless
# we add support to the test suite to fetch ntdll.pdb (as part of building the
# symcache?), we accept either result.
