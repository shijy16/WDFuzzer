# 4 unaddressable access, 4 uninitialized access and 4 leak errors are
# generated by the test.  For each of the 4, the first two will be suppressed
# mod+offs style (i.e., inside libdrmemory.so) and the latter two by mod!func
# suppression in postprocess.pl.
# with PR 477013 the summary is printed by postprocess after both types of
# suppression.

# i#292: There are 5 leaks and 2 possible leaks, all of which we suppress.  The
# 5th leak is still reachable from RtlpHeapFailureInfo on Vista+.  If we have
# ntdll.pdb we find and ignore roots in RtlpHeapFailureInfo, giving us 7
# suppressed leaks.  If we don't have ntdll.pdb, we only find 4+2 leaks.  Unless
# we add support to the test suite to fetch ntdll.pdb (as part of building the
# symcache?), we accept either result.
